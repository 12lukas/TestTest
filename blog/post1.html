  <h1>How to "Meme" people into buying from you</h1>
  <strong>Name: Ben Settler, Email: Ben@bensettle.com Category: Marketing, Published 21.03.2022</strong>
  <p>I recently saw an especially amusing meme that went like this:<br>

    1. A smiling boomer is posing next to his brand new lamborghini<br>

    2. The meme says:<br>

    My boss arrived at work in a brand-new lamborghini. I said, “Wow, that’s an amazing car! He replied, “If you work
    hard, put all your hours in, and strive for excellence, I’ll get another one next year.”<br>

    That meme is as funny as it is useful for a lot of reasons. Especially if you are in the business of influence &
    persuasion using email marketing.<br>

    The main reason?<br>

    It’s rooted in truth.<br>

    Everyone with a boss knows — on some level — they are working to give that boss a lifestyle.<br>

    All good jokes, just like all good marketing, is based in truth.<br>

    The best comedians have long known this.<br>

    Jokes based in nonsense or lies fall flat. <br>

    In fact, if I was trying to sell MLM, biz opp, investment info, or any kind of offer directed at blue collar workers
    who want to quit their jobs I’d be writing emails, ads, and other marketing using that meme all day long.<br>

    All right that’s that.
